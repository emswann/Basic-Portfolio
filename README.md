Items on the to do list:
  * Create the action file for the contacts form. (Once I learn more.)
  * Add links to the personal social webpage. Links are currently pointing to top-level websites for testing functionality.

Known issues:
  * Background runs past the webpage if the viewport is larger than the webpage (width).
  * Not very responsive. Some parts are and some parts are not. It still needs work.
  * Concentrated on the functionality first. It still needs the personal touch. I tried to match the layout as closely as possible to the screenshots, but some cosmetic things may still be off - centering images dynamically, etc.
